abstract = {Abstract Background Canine atopic dermatitis (cAD) is an allergic skin disease affecting approximately 10\% of dogs. allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT) is currently the only treatment option able to induce tolerance to the causative allergens. Objective To retrospectively establish the efficacy of ASIT in atopic dogs. Animals Client-owned (n  = 664) dogs with cAD presented between 2008 and 2018 to two dermatology referral clinics. Materials and Methods Clinical records of atopic dogs were reviewed to obtain information including the results of the intradermal skin test and/or allergen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E serological results, the allergens included in the ASIT, concurrent symptomatic medications, and ASIT efficacy after at least 9 months. Results Excellent (ASIT alone controlled clinical signs), good (≥50\% reduction of clinical signs) and poor (<50\% improvement) responses were seen in 31.5\%, 28.5\% and 40.1\% of the dogs, respectively. No significant differences in efficacy were associated with breed, sex, age at initiation of ASIT, type of allergens in ASIT, and between clinics. Dogs re-examined regularly responded significantly better to ASIT than dogs that did not (>50\% improvement in 69.3\% and 55.4\% of the dogs, respectively). Dogs treated with ASIT and concomitant systemic glucocorticoids showed a significantly poorer response (success rate of >50\% improvement of 38.5\%). Conclusions and clinical importance In 59.9\% of atopic dogs, subcutaneous ASIT can improve clinical signs by ≥50\%. The beneficial effect of ASIT is higher if dogs are re-examined regularly and if systemic long-term corticosteroids are avoided, at least during the first 9 months of ASIT.},

ABSTRACT={Although many artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based algorithms are being developed by researchers, only a small fraction has been implemented in clinical-decision support (CDS) systems for clinical care. Healthcare organizations experience significant barriers implementing AI/ML models for diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring purposes. In this perspective, we delve into the numerous and diverse quality control measures and responsibilities that emerge when moving from AI/ML-model development in a research environment to deployment in clinical care. The Sleep-Well Baby project, a ML-based monitoring system, currently being tested at the neonatal intensive care unit of the University Medical Center Utrecht, serves as a use-case illustrating our personal learning journey in this field. We argue that, in addition to quality assurance measures taken by the manufacturer, user responsibilities should be embedded in a quality management system (QMS) that is focused on life-cycle management of AI/ML-CDS models in a medical routine care environment. Furthermore, we highlight the strong similarities between AI/ML-CDS models and in vitro diagnostic devices and propose to use ISO15189, the quality guideline for medical laboratories, as inspiration when building a QMS for AI/ML-CDS usage in the clinic. We finally envision a future in which healthcare institutions run or have access to a medical AI-lab that provides the necessary expertise and quality assurance for AI/ML-CDS implementation and applies a QMS that mimics the ISO15189 used in medical laboratories.}

    abstract = "{Sleep is an important driver of early brain development. However, sleep is often disturbed in preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We aimed to develop an automated algorithm based on routinely measured vital parameters to classify sleep–wake states of preterm infants in real-time at the bedside.In this study, sleep–wake state observations were obtained in 1-minute epochs using a behavioral scale developed in-house while vital signs were recorded simultaneously. Three types of vital parameter data, namely, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, were collected at a low-frequency sampling rate of 0.4 Hz. A supervised machine learning workflow was used to train a classifier to predict sleep–wake states. Independent training (n = 37) and validation datasets were validation n = 9) datasets were used. Finally, a setup was designed for real-time implementation at the bedside.The macro-averaged area-under-the-receiver-operator-characteristic (AUROC) of the automated sleep staging algorithm ranged between 0.69 and 0.82 for the training data, and 0.61 and 0.78 for the validation data. The algorithm provided the most accurate prediction for wake states (AUROC = 0.80). These findings were well validated on an independent sample (AUROC = 0.77).With this study, to the best of our knowledge, a reliable, nonobtrusive, and real-time sleep staging algorithm was developed for the first time for preterm infants. Deploying this algorithm in the NICU environment may assist and adapt bedside clinical work based on infants’ sleep–wake states, potentially promoting the early brain development and well-being of preterm infants.}",
