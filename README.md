# CV 

This repository contains my CV in LaTeX.

## GitHub actions
We build the CV using a [GitHub action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-for-latex) to compile LaTeX.

## Licence CV template
The CV template is adapted from
Trey Hunter's [Medium Length Professional CV](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/medium-length-professional-cv) and downloaded from
`http://www.LaTeXTemplates.com`.
